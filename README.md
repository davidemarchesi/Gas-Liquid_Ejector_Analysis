# Gas-Liquid Ejector Multiphase Flow Analysis
The goal of the project is to evaluate the entrainment ratio and the phase distribution in an axisymmetric gas-liquid ejector,
testing the influence of interfacial forces and turbulence models on the accuracy of the results. A discussion on how the local flow
phenomena affects the performance of the ejector, together with a glimpse on the possible various applications of this type of system
is also made.

For these purposes is used the software **Ansys Fluent** for a complete CFD analysis.

The project is under development, and the folder will be gradually filled with simulations' files, results, and with the final document.
